* TODO Is there an attribute to organize decks together? This seemed possible when I looked at shared decks.
* DONE Difficulty
** DONE Have cards.py parse a difficulty field and create separate decks of easy/hard cards (not case sensitive)
** DONE Add "difficulty" field to the template creator
** DONE Add a "difficulty" field to the existing yaml files
