* TODO When cards are new, and in a custom deck, cards.py treats them as not existing and creates duplicates.
* TODO Is there an attribute to organize decks together? This seemed possible when I looked at shared decks.
* DONE Trick for find-and-replace with increment? C-M-% text \,(+ 1 \#)
* DONE Recreating duplicate cards with color scheme changed. Why?
* DONE Fix bug that allows recreation of existing cards.
* DONE Add tag field, for grabbing subsets of a deck
* DONE Difficulty
** DONE Have cards.py parse a difficulty field and create separate decks of easy/hard cards (not case sensitive)
** DONE Add "difficulty" field to the template creator
** DONE Add a "difficulty" field to the existing yaml files
** DONE Remove difficulty field? I don't see myself doing these very often. 
* DONE HTML for lists when I have multiple variations like (A), (B), (C), etc.?
