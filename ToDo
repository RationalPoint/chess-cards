* TODO Difficulty
** TODO Have cards.py parse a difficulty field and create separate decks of easy/hard cards (not case sensitive)
** TODO Add "difficulty" field to the template creator
** TODO Add a "difficulty" field to the existing yaml files
* TODO Is there an attribute to organize decks together? This seemed possible when I looked at shared decks.
* TODO HTML for lists when I have multiple variations like (A), (B), (C), etc.?
